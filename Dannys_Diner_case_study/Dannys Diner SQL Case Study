# Dannys Diner SQL Case Study
Dannys Diner notebook is a Case Study where a restuarnt owner Danny has some datasets and I used the data to answer a few simple questions about his 
customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. 
Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally 
he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

I have answered his questions in SQL queries within python code and this is an application of SQL to real life business analytics scenarios
